<summary>Why IIIT Guwahati</summary>
<p>
1. Affiliation: Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati (IIITG) is an institution under MHRD, Govt. of India. A Bill (Act of Parliament) to declare all the PPP-IIITs (including IIITG) as Institutes of National Importance has been passed in Lok Sabha.

2. Permanent Campus: The Institute has shifted to its permanent campus in July 2018. Students are staying in the hostels inside the campus. Most of the faculty members are staying in the faculty residence within the campus itself. The campus is located on a 67 acre plot, 4 km from Guwahati airport, on the National Highway.

3. Director: Prof. Gautam Barua former Director of IIT Guwahati is the Director of the Institute.

10. Sports & Recreation: A healthy mind resides in a healthy body. Sports and games are a major aspect of complete development both physically and mentally for a person. In this competitive age, sports is equally essential to supplement and enhance the academic development. The students at IIITG indulge in a number of sporting activities like basketball, football, badminton, etc. which inculcate in them a spirit to participate, compete and win. IIIT Guwahati has its annual techno-cultural-sports fest named “Yuvaan” to give equal opportunities to boys and girls to portray their skills in various fields of recreation and sports

<summary>Academic Structure</summary>
<p>At IIITG, undergraduate education emphasizes on a broad academic foundation, development of deep subject-area knowledge, a variety of rich learning experiences inside and outside the classroom, and cultivation of skills to help students become lifelong learners. With an enduring dedication to the pursuit of excellence, IIIT-G offers unparalleled student experiences across a broad spectrum of academics environment. The B.Tech courses offered at IIITG are:

B.Tech. in CSE
The programme is designed to create innovators and researchers. Students are given a strong foundation in CSE that includes electronics and hardware. The B.Tech (CSE) program at IIIT-Guwahati starts with computing oriented courses first, and allows the possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for an IT program, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer applications and possibilities of relating IT with these subjects.

B.Tech. in ECE
The programme is designed to create innovators and researchers. ECE courses like electronics, signals & systems, communications, VLSI, and embedded systems are introduced in the early semesters. Students also take a number of CSE oriented courses: Programming, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Networks.  The main objectives of the B.Tech (ECE) program are to produce students who are well prepared for Indian industry with necessary core competency to succeed long-term in engineering/entrepreneurship careers (post B.Tech), and who are well prepared to undertake PG studies and research careers.

The academic year has been divided into two semesters namely the MONSOON semester from July-Dec and the WINTER semester from Jan-May.

The winter vacation period for students is generally in the month of December and the summer vacation period is from the beginning of May to the third week of July.
