<p>Labs are of immense importance to study core engineering subjects like computer science or electronics and communication. At IIITG, the labs are well equipped with state-of-the art equipment and latest hi-tech gadgets. The lab assistants are experienced and guide the students with competence through both curriculum and research work. Our labs foster an atmosphere of independent research under the guidance of instructors. Further, students are allowed to perform experiments individually or in a group of two.
